ROOT is a data analysis software framework developed by CERN (https://root.cern.ch/), which is regularly used by particle physicists.

The framework is C++ based but also has a python extension called pyroot (https://root.cern.ch/pyroot)

There are tutorials for pyroot at https://root.cern/doc/master/group__tutorial__pyroot.html
